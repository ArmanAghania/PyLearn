# Image Processing - Assingment 10
**Supplementary topics**

All the processing and image creations are done with opencv-python.

## 1. PNG (Portable Network Graphics)
Transparent your Microsoft logo and remove it's background.
Save result with .png format.

## 2. Color Recognition
Write a program with webcam like Assignment 27 - 4 to recognize these colors:
Red - Green - Blue - Yellow - Orange - Purple - White - Black

## 4. PIL (Python Imaging Library) Don't use OpenCV 

* Read a color image with PIL.
* Write a ŸÖÿ™ŸÜ ŸÅÿßÿ±ÿ≥€å on image.
* Calculate 3 histograms and show with plt.
* Equalizes the image histogram.
* Convert image to gray.
* Calculate histogram and show with plt.
* Equalizes the gray image histogram.

## 5. Image Encryption and Decryption üîê

**Image Encryption** is the process of converting a normal image into a cipher image using a secret key in such a way that unauthorized users can't access it.

**Image Decryption** is the process of converting the cipher image into the original image by employing the secret key. Mainly, decryption operation is like encryption operation but applies in reverse order.

* Write `encryptor.py` to get an image, then generate a random secret key and encrypt the image using secret key. Finally save the encrypted image as a `.bmp` file and save the secret key as a `.npy` file.

* Write `decryptor.py` to get a cipher image and a secret key, then convert the cipher image into the original image. Finally save the decrypted image as a `.jpg` file.

* Write `main.py` using PySide6 (Qt for Python) to show input and output in GUI.
