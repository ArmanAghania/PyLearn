# Image Processing - Assingment 7

All the processing and image creations are done with opencv-python.

## 1. Convolution 2D
* Apply five 2D filters with different kernels on your custom image. 

    ```# 1. Edge detection filter
        kernel = np.array([[-1 , -1 , -1],
                        [-1 ,  8 , -1],
                        [-1 , -1 , -1]])

        # 2. Sharpening filter
        kernel = np.array([[0  , -1 ,  0],
                        [-1 ,  5 , -1],
                        [0  , -1 ,  0]])

        # 3. Emboss filter
        kernel = np.array([[-2 , -1 ,  0],
                        [-1 ,  1 ,  1],
                        [0  ,  1 ,  2]])

        # 4. Identity filter
        kernel = np.array([[0  ,  0 ,  0],
                        [0  ,  1 ,  0],
                        [0  ,  0 ,  0]])

        # 5. Your filter
        kernel = # what ever you want```

* Use np.hstack() to place the output image next to the input image.

## 2. The Magic ðŸª„ðŸ”®
Use the average filter to reveal hidden things.

### Input

![!dice](https://github.com/ArmanAghania/PyLearn/blob/main/Image%20Processing/Session%207/Assignment/magic/1.tif)

### Output

## 3. Median Filter
Use median filter to reduce noise in images. How do you feel? Is the average filter better or the median filter?

## 4. Histogram Equalization
We will learn the concepts of histogram equalization and use it to improve the contrast of our images.
