## 5. Blue Screen Technique 🟩🟦

The term “blue screen” is used to describe a film technique in which the background of a scene is filmed in front of what looks like a blue or green screen, then replaced by computer-generated imagery. The result is that actors can be inserted convincingly into scenes with backgrounds that are not otherwise possible.

Change the background of the image below. Fly Superman in the sky.
